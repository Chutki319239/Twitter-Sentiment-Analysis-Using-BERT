# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-BERT
This project performs real-time sentiment analysis of tweets using a fine-tuned BERT model and integrates Google Gemini API for advanced response verification. Built with a sleek Streamlit frontend, it allows users to input tweet text or a Twitter handle to determine whether the content is positive or negative.

🚀 Key Features:

🔤 Text + Twitter Handle Input: Accepts direct tweet input or scrapes recent tweets from a given handle

🤖 BERT-Based Sentiment Classification: Transformer model for accurate binary sentiment prediction

🧠 Google Gemini API Integration: Verifies sentiment, explains context, and adds generative summaries

📊 Clean and Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit with sentiment icons, pie chart, and intuitive layout

🧪 Model Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

Python, PyTorch, Transformers (BERT)

Selenium for tweet scraping

Streamlit for web interface

Google Gemini API for verification

📝 How to Use:
